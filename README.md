# Regular Grammar

> Status: Developed ✔️

### A program that simulate Regular Grammar

A regular grammar simulator must be implemented, which receives the formal specification of the grammar 
and a sequence of strings and checks if the strings can be generated by the grammar.

## Input:
- The first line of input will contain the N set of non-terminal symbols, which must consist of capital letters only (A to Z).
- The second line will contain the alphabet (represented by $\sum$), which must consist only of digits (0 to 9), lowercase letters (a to z) and underscore ( _ ).
- The third line will contain the grammar start symbol.
- The fourth line will contain an integer P (1 ≤ P ≤ |N| x | |) indicating the number of grammar productions.
- The next P lines will have the productions, in the form “ Ni -> SkNj”, Ni, Nj ∈ N, Sk ∈ �.
- The next line will contain an integer C (1 ≤ C ≤ 100) that indicates the number of strings to be checked.
- The following C lines contain the strings to be checked. The strings will be between two “@” symbols. An empty string will be indicated by two "@" symbols followed.

## Output:
For each string to be checked, the simulator must simulate the grammar and then write two lines of output.
The first line must contain the tested string and the second line must contain the simulator response: “S” 
if the string can be generated by the grammar, or “N” if the string cannot be generated by the grammar.

In this problem, the symbol “λ” that represents the void in productions will be replaced by the symbol “#”.
